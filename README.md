# VirtualClassroomDashboard
California State University Masters Project

## Introduction     
The proposed project is about providing a more diverse environment for educators 
to immerse their students into their classes. Educators need one application to provide for their students and students need a single place to find all their materials for a given class. This is all about bridging the gap between communication and defining a diverse learning environment. 

## Problem Statement    
Learning Manage Systems have been around for several years. Each type of system contains some unique and similar sets of features. Each year new technology arises as well as new tools for learning. With these developments comes changes to the educational system in a more technological way. In 2020 the world was hit with the Covid-19 pandemic leaving institutions with no choice but to turn to online learning. This proved difficult because they had to find the right LMS and video conferencing application. Having multiple tools and platforms can prove to be difficult especially for lower levels of educations. Why can’t these tools be all in one? There is need for a uniform all-in-one easy to use platform where teachers can video chat, communicate, provide material, submissions, and assessments. 

“The best online learning combines elements where students go at their own pace, on their own time, and are set up to think deeply and critically about subject matter combined with elements where students go online at the same time and interact with other students, their teacher and content” (Greenhow, 2020). Education is a key asset to providing us with the tools to move through our life and careers. If the world were to move to hybrid or e-learning applications, they would need to be equipped with the best tools and be flexible. As we move toward the future how we learn will be an ongoing issue especially if there is another pandemic or outbreak of some kind. 

## Development Environment  
The Full Stack Application is going to be a C# ASP.Net internet application that will be hosted using a web server. It will be cross-browser compatible and responsive for all device types. This application will work on any operating system because it is a web-based application. The main languages used for the software development will be HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, embedded SQL statements, and C#. It will also be using a MySQL relational database using constraints and keys. The tools used to develop this application will be Visual Studio 2019, Zoom/WebEx API, Microsoft SQL Server (for development), GitHub, Azure Database(for deployed application), and a web server hosted in a cloud provider such as Azure

## Deliverables  
The final product of this project will be a full stack application that provides a multi-tier platform for users such as: educators, admins, and students. Along with the application a Final Report with a full explanation of development and software, 3 User Manuals that include: 1 for educators, 1 for admins, and 1 for students, the source code for the project, and a Demonstration will be provided.
