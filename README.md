# VirtualClassroomDashboard
California State University Masters Project

## Introduction     
The proposed project is about providing a more diverse environment for educators 
to immerse their students into their classes. Educators need one application to provide for their students and students need a single place to find all their materials for a given class. This is all about bridging the gap between communication and defining a diverse learning environment. 

## Problem Statement    
The covid19 pandemic has shown how switching to online is not all that easy at any educational level. It is both a hardship on the educators and the students. Many educators especially at lower levels have issues with using multiple platforms for providing their students with lessons, materials, and communication. Why canâ€™t all of this be all one platform? By creating a uniform platform where educators can video chat, communicate, provide materials, and submissions, this should bridge the gap of issues and hardships on those out there who need a all in one easy to use learning/teaching platform. 

## Deliverables  
The final product of this project will be a full stack application that provides a multi-tier platform for users such as: educators, admins, and students. Along with the application a Final Report with a full explanation of development and software, 3 User Manuals that include: 1 for educators, 1 for admin, and 1 for students, the source code for the project, and Demonstration will be provided.
